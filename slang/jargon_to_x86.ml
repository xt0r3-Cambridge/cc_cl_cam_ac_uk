This file contains a VERY simple translation of Jargon to x86 assembler. 
The generated code attempts to closely mimic the Jargon virtual machine. 
Calling slang with the -i4x86 option and file foo.slang  will generate 
a foo.s file of assembler (with comments!), and a compiled version 
"foo" that you can run from the command line (foo.s is compiled and
linked with the runtime system (runtime/c_runtime.c). 

Thanks for help from Nathan Corbyn who implemented 
rusty_slang here https://github.com/doctorn/rusty_slang. 

A few comments on the code below: 

-- No optimisations have been implemented. 
-- No garbage collection is implemented. Heap allocated 
   records do not yet have headers. 
-- runtime system only prints out integers correctly. 
   This is related to having no headers. Discuss. 
-- the scratch register %r11 is used to hold a pointer to 
   the heap, which is passed in by the runtime system. 
-- register %rax is being used for scratch, not really as an accumulator. 
-- Close inspection of generated code will reveal why it would be good idea
   to use %rax as an accumulator. That is, always have to top-of-stack in %rax. 
-- The only function calls/returns that follow the C calling 
   conventions are those that interact with the runtime system
   (the "alloc" function is called to allocate records on the heap, 
   and the main function "giria" is called from the runtime system).
-- "giria" means "slang" in Portuguese.
